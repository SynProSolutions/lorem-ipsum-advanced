# Tree rearrangement
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Tree rearrangements are used in heuristic algorithms devoted to searching for an optimal tree 
structure. They can be applied to any set of data that are naturally arranged into a tree, but have 
most applications in computational phylogenetics, especially in maximum parsimony and maximum 
likelihood searches of phylogenetic trees, which seek to identify one among many possible trees that 
best explains the evolutionary history of a particular gene or species.
